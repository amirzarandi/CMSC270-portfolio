# Final Reflection
### Amir Zarandi


## Grade Assignment

Based on my performance throughout the course and the evidence I have provided, I would like to self-assign a grade of **A** for CMSC 270. I believe my work demonstrates a strong understanding of the course material and showcases my ability to apply concepts in various contexts. I have met the requirements for each learning goal and have gone above and beyond in some areas.

## Justifications for Grade

#### L1: Design and Implementation of Basic Data Structures
I have showcased my understanding of the interface for different data structures, and I can describe the purpose and functionality of each structure, for instance in POE2 from exam 1 I explain how array-based lists work, and in POE4 from exam 1 I explain when queues might be preferred to stacks.
I have demonstrated my ability to implement these data structures in C++ without relying on the Standard Template Library. The evidence provided includes implementations of binary search trees (POE1) and doubly linked lists (POE4).

#### L2: Applications of Basic Data Structures
I have a solid understanding of time complexity and space complexity and can reason through the likely time complexity of operations on different data structures. I have provided explanations and justifications for the time complexities of various sorting and searching algorithms (POE1 & POE3).
I have implemented sorting and searching algorithms, including merge sort (POE2), and binary search (POE4). These implementations highlight my ability to write sorting algorithms without relying on the Standard Template Library.


#### L3: Reading and Writing Computationally
I come to class well-prepared, having read and taken notes on the assigned material. I actively engage in discussions and ask questions to deepen my understanding (POE1: Perusall comment on doubly-linked lists section from the text book).
I am proficient in translating pseudocode into C++ code (POE4: Recursive Binary Search implementation from pseudocode). This is evident in my implementations provided in the evidence.
I am capable of effectively reading and understanding C++ documentation related to the covered data structures (POE3: Perusall comment on cpp pointers documentation). Furthermore, I have demonstrated my ability to implement data structures as described in C++ documentation (POE2:  set application after reading the relevant cpp documentation) 

#### L4: Failure
I embrace challenges and approach problems with a growth mindset. Even when encountering difficulties, I persevere and work through them (POE3: homework three where answering question 3 was out of my comfort zone and I had to do a lot of thinking) (POE4: Group exam 2 issues with code).
I am comfortable with taking incremental steps and learning from small failures along the way (POE1: Group exam 1 mistake using array implementation of a queue instead of a linked list implementation).
I understand where I got stuck and recognize the learning gained from those experiences (POE2: exam 1 error in conceptualizing deleting array element ).

#### L5: Reflection and Metacognition
I have consistently responded to feedback provided throughout the course, revising my work accordingly. The evidence includes revised versions of assignments, exams, and self-reflective grading sheets.

In conclusion, my self-assigned grade of **A** is justified by the evidence provided for each learning goal. I have shown a solid grasp of the design and implementation of basic data structures, the applications of these structures, computational reading and writing skills, resilience in the face of failure, and a reflective mindset.
